# Penetration Testing Project Documentation

## Project Overview:

This penetration testing project aimed to assess the security posture of Chiperninja's network infrastructure through comprehensive testing and analysis. The primary objectives included identifying vulnerabilities, exploiting security weaknesses, and providing actionable recommendations to improve overall security resilience.

## Methodologies:

### 1. Reconnaissance:
   - Conducted passive and active reconnaissance to gather information about the target network, including IP ranges, domain names, and network services.
   
### 2. Vulnerability Assessment:
   - Utilized automated scanning tools such as Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS to identify potential vulnerabilities in network hosts and services.

### 3. Exploitation:
   - Exploited identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to network resources, systems, and applications.

### 4. Privilege Escalation:
   - Attempted to escalate privileges on compromised systems to gain higher levels of access and control.

### 5. Post-Exploitation:
   - Conducted post-exploitation activities to maintain persistence, gather additional information, and escalate privileges further.

## Key Findings:

### 1. Outdated Remote Service:
   - Exploited an outdated remote service on [X.X.X.X] to gain initial access to the network.
   
### 2. Misconfigured Security Policies:
   - Identified misconfigured security policies leading to privilege escalation opportunities, allowing for unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

### 3. Credential Dumping:
   - Extracted credentials from LSASS memory, leading to lateral movement and access to additional client machines.

### 4. Password Cracking:
   - Cracked passwords from a KeePass database found on [X,X,X,X], revealing credentials for the "frank.admin" account, which had domain administrator privileges.

### 5. Domain Access:
   - Successfully logged into the domain using the compromised "frank.admin" account, demonstrating full access to domain resources.

## Recommendations:

### 1. Patch Management:
   - Implement a robust patch management process to regularly update and secure all software and services, especially remote access tools.
   
### 2. Security Policy Review:
   - Conduct a thorough review of security policies and configurations to ensure proper enforcement of least privilege principles and access controls.

### 3. Credential Management:
   - Enforce strong password policies, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly rotate credentials to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

### 4. Network Segmentation:
   - Implement network segmentation to limit lateral movement and isolate critical resources from potential compromise.

### 5. Employee Training:
   - Provide comprehensive security awareness training to employees to educate them about common attack vectors, phishing techniques, and best security practices.

## Conclusion:

The penetration testing project provided valuable insights into the security weaknesses present within Chiperninja's network infrastructure. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities and implementing the recommended measures, Chiperninja can enhance its security posture, mitigate risks, and safeguard against potential cyber threats in the future.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive summary of the penetration testing project, outlining its objectives, methodologies, key findings, recommendations, and conclusions.
